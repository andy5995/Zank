# Zank
Text (console/cli) game. Can you find enough magic rings and incriminating documents to indict and retire all the politicians before your HP runs out?

To build: gcc -Wall Zank.c -o Zank

i = show inventory

m = display map

q = quit

e,w,n,s = direction keys

When you are at position 0,0, you are at the bottom-left corner of the map.
When you are at position 9,9, you are in the top-right corner.

Don't attempt to invade the neighboring kingdom by going outside the map!

Inspiration for Zank came from games such as Zork, Legend of the Red Dragon (L.O.R.D.), and Lunatix.

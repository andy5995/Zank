Can you find enough magic rings and incriminating documents to indict and retire all the politicians before your HP runs out?\r\n\r\n[Screenshots](https://github.com/andy5995/Zank/tree/master/screenshots)\r\n[Releases](https://github.com/andy5995/Zank/releases)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAndy Alt (@andy5995)\r\n@mzdelong0\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIRC: Quakenet IRC network - #Zank\r\n[Bugs, TODO, and Feature Requests](https://github.com/andy5995/Zank/issues)\r\n[Forums](https://sourceforge.net/p/zank/discussion/)\r\n",
